* Windows configuration of =.emacs.d=
** Introduction
The following configuration works in windows system. The configurations are
specifically designed to work with local user **vj**.
** =.emacs.d= symlink
Depending on how emacs is installed in the syste, =.emacs.d= is loaded from
either =/C:\Users\vj\.emacs.d= or =C:\Users\vj\AppData\Roaming\.emacs.d=.
#+begin_src powershell
  MKLINK /J Link Target
  
  Link    Specifies the new symbolic link name.
  
  Target  Specifies the path (relative or absolute) that the new link
          refers to.
#+end_src
** Configuration files
I use literate configurations. This helps me to take notes and easily browse
through them in =gihub=.
