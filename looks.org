* Looks
Fonts, UI elements and color themes.
** Font
For windows the safest font is /Cascadia Mono/ at /14/.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist
               '(font . "Cascadia Mono-14"))
#+end_src
** Color theme
For different systems I would like to have different color themes.
*** Nimbus
The default color theme for Nimbus is /spacemacs-dark/.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package spacemacs-theme
  :defer t
  :init (load-theme 'spacemacs-dark t))
#+end_src
